    <h1>Q-1: What is DOM and what is the purpose of DOM?</h1>
    <p><strong>DOM:</strong> <br>
        The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents that represents the page so that
        programs can change the document structure, style, and content. <br>

    </p>
    <p><strong>Purpose of DOM</strong> <br> The purpose of the DOM is to provide a platform-neutral programming
        interface for web documents that can be used by various programming languages such as JavaScript, Python, and
        Ruby. The DOM provides a set of methods and properties that enable developers to access and manipulate the
        content of web pages dynamically at runtime.</p>

    <h1>Q-2: How will you select HTML elements using DOM? Name the DOM methods.</h1>
    <p>There are ways : <br>
        1. getElementsByTagName() <br>
        2. getElementsByClassName()<br>
        3. getElementById()<br>
        4. querySelector()<br>
        5. querySelectorAll() <br>
        6. element.getAttribute() <br>
        7. element.setAttribute()
    </p>


    <h1>Q-3: What is event bubble? </h1>
    <p>When an event is triggered on an element, such as a click event on a button, the event is first executed on the target element, and then the event bubbles up to the parent element, and then to its parent, and so on until it reaches the top of the DOM tree.</p>

    <h1>Q-4: What is a callback function and why will you use it?</h1>
    <p> A callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed by that function at a specific point in time or in response to a particular event or condition. In other words, a callback function is a function that is "called back" by another function.</p>
